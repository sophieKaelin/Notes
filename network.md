# Networking 

- OSI Model
	- Application; layer 7 (and basically layers 5 & 6) (includes API, HTTP, etc).
	- Transport; layer 4 (TCP/UDP).
	- Network; layer 3 (Routing).
	- Datalink; layer 2 (Error checking and frame synchronisation).
	- Physical; layer 1 (Bits over fibre).
	
-	Firewalls ✅
	- Rules to prevent incoming and outgoing connections.
	- Can be software or hardware filtration
	- Packet scanner/filter (removes the dodgy stuff)
	- Proxy Service: 2 other intermediaries that stops direct contact between customer and client services (slower)
	- Stateful inspection: checks against more than just the packet header. Cross checks packet data with a trusted db source (ip addr, ports, apps). Newer technique.
	
-	NAT ✅
	- Useful to understand IPv4 vs IPv6.
	- Network Address Translation
	- Used in routers
	- IPV4 became limited (not enough for all devices, 4 billion). So private IP addresses for networks created
	- Nat translates private IP addresses of all devices on home network into one public IP address and vice versa
	- Won't need NAT when IPv6 works dependably

- DNS
	- (53)
	- Requests to DNS are usually UDP, unless the server gives a redirect notice asking for a TCP connection. Look up in cache happens first. DNS exfiltration. Using raw IP addresses means no DNS logs, but there are HTTP logs. DNS sinkholes.
	- In a reverse DNS lookup, PTR might contain- 2.152.80.208.in-addr.arpa, which will map to  208.80.152.2. DNS lookups start at the end of the string and work backwards, which is why the IP address is backwards in PTR.

- DNS exfiltration 
	- Sending data as subdomains. 
	- 26856485f6476a567567c6576e678.badguy.com
	- Doesn’t show up in http logs. 

- DNS configs
	- Start of Authority (SOA).
	- IP addresses (A and AAAA).
	- SMTP mail exchangers (MX).
	- Name servers (NS).
	- Pointers for reverse DNS lookups (PTR).
	- Domain name aliases (CNAME).
 
- ARP
	- Pair MAC address with IP Address for IP connections. 

- DHCP
	- UDP (67 - Server, 68 - Client)
	- Dynamic address allocation (allocated by router).
	- `DHCPDISCOVER` -> `DHCPOFFER` -> `DHCPREQUEST` -> `DHCPACK`

- Multiplex 
	- Timeshare, statistical share, just useful to know it exists.

- Traceroute 
	- Usually uses UDP, but might also use ICMP Echo Request or TCP SYN. TTL, or hop-limit.
	- Initial hop-limit is 128 for windows and 64 for *nix. Destination returns ICMP Echo Reply. 

- Nmap 
	- Network scanning tool.

- Intercepts (MiTM) 
	- Understand PKI (public key infrastructure in relation to this).

- VPN 
	- Hide traffic from ISP but expose traffic to VPN provider.

- Tor 
	- Traffic is obvious on a network. 
	- How do organised crime investigators find people on tor networks. 

- Proxy  
	- Why 7 proxies won’t help you. 

- BGP
	- Border Gateway Protocol.
	- Holds the internet together.

- Network traffic tools
	- Wireshark
	- Tcpdump
	- Burp suite

- HTTP/S 
	- (80, 443)

- SSL/TLS
	- (443) 
	- Super important to learn this, includes learning about handshakes, encryption, signing, certificate authorities, trust systems. [A good primer on all these concepts and algorithms](https://english.ncsc.nl/publications/publications/2019/juni/01/it-security-guidelines-for-transport-layer-security-tls) is made available by the Dutch cybersecurity center.
	- Various attacks against older versions of SSL/TLS (with catchy names) on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Attacks_against_TLS/SSL).

- TCP/UDP
	- Web traffic, chat, voip, traceroute.
	- TCP will throttle back if packets are lost but UDP doesn't. 
	- Streaming can slow network TCP connections sharing the same network.

- ICMP 
	- Ping and traceroute.

- Mail
	- SMTP (25, 587, 465)
	- IMAP (143, 993)
	- POP3 (110, 995)

- SSH 
	- (22)
	- Handshake uses asymmetric encryption to exchange symmetric key.

- Telnet
	- (23, 992)
	- Allows remote communication with hosts.

- ARP  
	- Who is 0.0.0.0? Tell 0.0.0.1.
	- Linking IP address to MAC, Looks at cache first.

- DHCP 
	- (67, 68) (546, 547)
	- Dynamic (leases IP address, not persistent).
	- Automatic (leases IP address and remembers MAC and IP pairing in a table).
	- Manual (static IP set by administrator).

- IRC 
	- Understand use by hackers (botnets).

- FTP/SFTP 
	- (21, 22)

- RPC 
	- Predefined set of tasks that remote clients can execute.
	- Used inside orgs. 

- Service ports
	- 0 - 1023: Reserved for common services - sudo required. 
	- 1024 - 49151: Registered ports used for IANA-registered services. 
	- 49152 - 65535: Dynamic ports that can be used for anything. 

- HTTP Header
	- | Verb | Path | HTTP version |
	- Domain
	- Accept
	- Accept-language
	- Accept-charset
	- Accept-encoding(compression type)
	- Connection- close or keep-alive
	- Referrer
	- Return address
	- Expected Size?

- HTTP Response Header
	- HTTP version
	- Status Codes: 
		- 1xx: Informational Response
		- 2xx: Successful
		- 3xx: Redirection
		- 4xx: Client Error
		- 5xx: Server Error
	- Type of data in response 
	- Type of encoding
	- Language 
	- Charset

- UDP Header
	- Source port
	- Destination port
	- Length
	- Checksum

- Broadcast domains and collision domains. 
- Root stores
- CAM table overflow
